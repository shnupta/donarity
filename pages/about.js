                    <p>
                        Donarity allows people to make one-off, recurring and split donations to their favourite
                        charities, and manage them all in one place.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This makes the giving process easier and more personalised, allowing organisations to reach more
                        people and raise more funds, so they can achieve their mission. By simplifying the way people
                        donate, we can create more positive change in the world.

                        <p>Donarity was created as a group software engineering project by 4 Computing students at
                            Imperial College London. For our Designing for Real People project, we wanted to use our
                            technical skills to aid charities. Upon thinking of the ways we could help and doing user
                            research, the question we asked was:</p>
                    </Col>
                </Row>
                <br></br>

                    <Col md={6}>
                        <p>"How might we enable charities to reach a wider audience and communicate more effectively
                            with supporters, on a platform that would allow for individuals to manage their donations in
                            one place, discover new charities that align with their values, and see how their donated
                            money is being used?"</p>
